# custom-beamer-themes
These are custom beamer themes I made myself from scratch.

They do not have any portability in mind as I write them to fit whatever presentation I am making at the moment.

Pictures will follow when I have the time.

# "corporate"
This is a simple blue and orange theme inspired by the following post on stackexchange:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/146529/design-a-custom-beamer-theme-from-scratch

I used it to learn how to make my own beamer themes.

# "cleancode"
The theme I prefer to use when giving a programming-related talk. It is mostly empty and has 
overloaded boxes that I find pleasing.

# "jonaslight"
My theme for the Lattice Conference 2015. It has some simple geometric shapes and matching boxes.

The colour theme I got from here (slightly modified)
