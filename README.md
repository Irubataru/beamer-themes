# custom-beamer-themes
These are custom beamer themes I made myself from scratch.

They do not have any portability in mind as I write them to fit whatever presentation I am making at the moment.


# "corporate"
This is a simple blue and orange theme inspired by the following post on stackexchange:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/146529/design-a-custom-beamer-theme-from-scratch

I used it to learn how to make my own beamer themes.

Screenshots:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/corporate/corporate-1.png?raw=true" alt="Title Page" width="250">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/corporate/corporate-2.png?raw=true" alt="Items" width="250">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/corporate/corporate-3.png?raw=true" alt="Boxes" width="250">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

# "cleancode"
The theme I prefer to use when giving a programming-related talk. It is mostly empty and has 
overloaded boxes that I find pleasing.

This package needs the [dvipsnames,usenames] options for beamer.

Screenshots:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/clean.code/cleancode-1.png?raw=true" alt="Title Page" width="250">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/clean.code/cleancode-2.png?raw=true" alt="Items" width="250">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/clean.code/cleancode-3.png?raw=true" alt="Boxes1" width="250">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/clean.code/cleancode-4.png?raw=true" alt="Boxes2" width="250">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/clean.code/cleancode-5.png?raw=true" alt="Boxes3" width="250">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

# "LightRound"
My theme for the Lattice Conference 2015. It has some simple geometric shapes and matching boxes.

The colour theme I got from here (slightly modified)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/light.theme/light_theme-1.png?raw=true" alt="Title Page" width="250">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/light.theme/light_theme-2.png?raw=true" alt="Items" width="250">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/light.theme/light_theme-3.png?raw=true" alt="Boxes1" width="250">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="/../screenshots/screenshots/light.theme/light_theme-4.png?raw=true" alt="Boxes2" width="250">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

# "LightSquare"
Basically the same as LightRound, but with all the circles replaced with rectangles. Screenshots might follow.

# Installation

Standard LaTeX installation, put the files somewhere LaTeX can find them. I normally put these in

```bash
$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/beamer/themes/
```
